# Node

About code snippets
In this module, some examples will present code to be executed in the node REPL (similar to irb), this code will be written with lines starting with prompt indicators (>) indicating what should be typed, and other lines what should be printed.

Other code examples without prompt indicators at all should be written to JavaScript files. Snippets starting with $ will indicate commands to type in the terminal (outside the node program).

Use prettier to put semi-colon on the end of a line:
npx prettier --write .
or
npx prettier --check .
