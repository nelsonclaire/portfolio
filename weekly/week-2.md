# Week 2

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------

## Goals

By the end of this week I can:

* Use all of week 1's skills 
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

1. Pairing using the driver-navigator style during afternoons
    - [Oystercard](https://github.com/nelsonclaire/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/oystercard.md)

2. Weekend challenge to consolidate what I have learnt this week
    - [Takeaway](https://github.com/nelsonclaire/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/takeaway.md)

--------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
pretty good
Could you summarise the work we did together?
not sure how to summarise.
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
perfectly balanced as all things should be.
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
the in journey method gets applied after we check if we are raising and error.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
future proofing your code. Creating minimum fair instead of taking from min balance which allows future change to code to be easier.

---------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
I remember it being good code, and feeling positive after the session.
Could you summarise the work we did together?
Sorry I’ve left so much time inbetween doing this I can’t exactly remember
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
I felt you striked a good balance, you were confident and chatty but let me speak/get my thoughts across.
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
Can’t remember sorry. I felt good after the session and like the pairing session was successful.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
See above :)

02/02/2022 Pairing feedback from Tim Ogilvie-Harris
---------------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
Code was good - i think it was clean and clear what to read.
Could you summarise the work we did together?
We worked with hashes and arrays to track and store the journeys. Worked to create a station class to record the name and zones of the station.
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
I think you struck a good balance. Interjected when you felt you could offer something and always asked permission before helping.
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
Helped me understand before each better than before.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
Better understanding of the before all and each statements.

03/02/2022 Pairing feedback from Ed Cope
----------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
We achieved most of the intended functionality. We perhaps could have refactored a bit more. But this was mostly an exercise of moving code without breaking the overall program.
Could you summarise the work we did together?
Our challenge was to deal with a class that was responsible for too many actions.
We extracted a class which currently had a number of tests associated with it.
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
I think the balance was fine. This was a hard task for us both in terms of understanding, so we spend a lot of the time aligning on what functionality which required good communication.
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
I was struggling with the concept of how we should maintain our tests whilst moving them and which object they shared relevance with. I feel you helped me understand that.
For an improvement, in the described example I think you prompted the right method earlier in the session, and perhaps I would have understood quicker if you implemented this further, but we focused on my misunderstanding.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
It really challenged me to try and adjust my understanding of another codebase that I hadn't started with myself. So I learnt about how to understand different thought processes to reach the goal.

04/02/2022 Pairing feedback from Camilla Greene
-----------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
Clear, well written and easy to read.
Could you summarise the work we did together?
Steps 12 and 13 - adding journey history and creating station class of the Oyster Card challenge.
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
Great balance of speaking and listening! You gave me the opportunity to navigate and stepped in when and debugged when error messages where popping up.
(Sorry if I wasn't navigating as much as you would have liked. It's my target for improvement.)
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
Why our station class wasn't working and why we needed to use the let(:) syntax to get it to work.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
The above and a reminder of the importance/use of using attribute readers.
