# Project: JS and Notes

## I am working towards achieving these goals

- I can pair program
- I can model anything
- I can TDD anything

------

### Testing
- [ ] 90% or greater test coverage.
- [ ] Unit tests:
  - [ ] test one piece of your own logic.
  - [ ] fail if that logic breaks.
  - [ ] pass if it that logic produces the expected result.
- [ ] You can articulate why any test exists (or does not exist).
- [ ] Every feature is tested from the user's perspective.

### Good distribution of work
- [ ] Your team co-owns the code. Every member of the team can:
  - [ ] explain _why_ any part of the application exists (what user need it solves).
  - [ ] explain _how_ any aspect of the application works.
- [ ] Every member of the team has made commits.
- [ ] Every completed ticket has a closed (or merged) Pull Request.

### Quality of work
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and composed of:
  - [ ] a single line describing the changes made.
  - [ ] a description of the problem it solves, with reference to the user.
- [ ] The linter passes on all commits.
- [ ] All commits have a low complexity score.
- [ ] All pull requests are peer reviewed.

### Documentation
- [ ] There is up-to-date documentation:
  - [ ] a project description.
  - [ ] how to install and run it.
  - [ ] how to run tests.

It's also a great idea for your team to keep some sort of record of your learning process.  This could take the form of a blog, a wiki or any other format you like.

## Additional Criteria â€“ Weeks 8 and 9 (Engineering Projects)

- [ ] Merging any branch into `main` automatically deploys after passing automated tests.
- [ ] All code on `main` is containerised.
- [ ] `main` is deployed into production.
