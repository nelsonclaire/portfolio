--------------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
I think the code we wrote together (both the testing and the program one) was simple, and geared to solving the challenges that were given to us. I think we came up with similar solutions in the code we wrote, and I think the code we wrote was the product of collaborative thinking.

Could you summarise the work we did together?
Explored error messages in a Ruby environment (for example, when we try to "do something" with an instance (the DockingStation class, for example) that was nowhere defined previously.
Explored the Domain Model from User Stories: we've created schemas of the objects/actions we need from a program, starting from "user narratives" (in other words: the specifications of our program were given to us in the form of user experiences or requirements, and we distilled those into tables/diagrams)
We've created a basic test around a specific feature of the program (the DockingStation object that _responds to_ an action request (release_bike).
We've created basic code to fulfull the test requirements.

Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
I think you had a good balance of talking and listening. There were times when we were independently trying to figure out solutions to problems by googling things; other times when we "thought out loud", other times when we listened to each other. I also liked the natural way and organic approach to non-programming chat.

What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
You explained well some concepts around git . I also found reassuring that we had a similar understanding of the main issues around the error messages we found throughout the steps (DomainName errors). I don't think there was something you didn't explain or express well.

What did you learn from pairing with me?
I learnt some git and CLI commands I didn't know or did not remember at hand. It was also my first full pair programming session, and I think I learnt the basics of the driver/navigator principles.

---------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
Some great stuff. Easily used refactored one liner tests and all work as expected with one responsibility per method. Thanks for a very productive afternoon!
Could you summarise the work we did together?
Worked on the Boris bike challenges 8-12. Pair programming swapping navigator and driver over zoom/git/GitHub/Vasco de/commandline
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
Lovely balance!
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
How to create initialised constants.

What did you learn from pairing with me?
The answer is out there! Read all material from the question/source page

27/01/2022 Pairing feedback from Trushna Rabadia
------------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
I'm very happy and proud of the progress we made together. The code we wrote together does seem to be working. Although we did take peeks at the walkthroughs when required, we only adapted what we understood from them and nothing further.
Could you summarise the work we did together?
We completed approx. 5 chapters of the Boris Bikes challenge.
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
A very good balance of both, I didn't feel like I was doing all the work, nor did I feel that you were taking over. I felt that we both worked well and bounced off each other.
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
There were quite a few things I asked you to explain that I was unsure of, I think you explained well as I didn't find myself questioning them later when putting them in the code. N/A for second question.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
We learned how to use attribute readers and writers together

-----------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
It was confusing, and I don't think I really understand it, but it seemed to work in the end!
Could you summarise the work we did together?
We went back over steps 8-12 (or thereabouts) and Claire talked me through steps I had not yet completed. We ended refactoring my existing code quite a lot.
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
Good balance!
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
I can't remember specific examples sorry! Helped me go through a few of the users stories and bits of code which was helpful, even if I still didn't get it by the end.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
Practiced the rspec stuff/writing test code
```
------

Driver:
  - Write the code according to the navigator's specification
  - Listen intently to the navigators instructions
  - Ask questions wherever there is a lack of clarity
  - Offer alternative solutions if you disagree with the navigator
  - Where there is disagreement, defer to the navigator. If their idea fails, get to failure quickly and move on
  - Make sure code is clean
  - Own the computer / keyboard
  - Ignore larger issues and focus on the task at hand
  - Trust the navigator - ultimately the navigator has the final say in what is written
  - You are writing the code 

Navigator:
  - Dictates the code that is to be written - the 'what'
  - Clearly communicates what code to write
  - Explains 'why' they have chosen the particular solution to this problem
  - Check for syntax / type errors as the Driver drives
  - Be the safety net for the driver
  - Make sure that the driver sticks to the small task at hand
  - Outline and note down high level tasks / issues
  - Ongoing code review
  - Pay attention
  - Wait until the task is complete to bring up design / refactoring issues

Both:
  - Actively take part in programming
  - Aim for optimal flow - avoid trying to be 'right'
  - Embrace your role
  - Intervene if your pair is quiet
  - Know when to give up / steal keyboard
  - Communicate, communicate, COMMUNICATE!
  - Sync up frequently to make sure you are on the same page
  - Don't hog the keyboard
  - High-five every time a test passes
  - Follow best practices for TDD
  - Swap roles frequently
