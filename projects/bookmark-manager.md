--------------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
Super!
Could you summarise the work we did together?
We set up our database project together
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
Great balance!
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
My memory is a little fuzzy sorry, but I know you helped me out with any bits I got stuck on!
What did you learn from pairing with me?
Who knew Monday's could be so fun!

What do you think of the code we wrote together?
We didn't write a huge amount of code today as we spent a lot of time setting up new programs, databases etc, but I think what we did write went well - even when we leaned on the walkthrough for help, we were making sure to discuss the code together and help each other to solve errors.
Could you summarise the work we did together?
We learned how to add/remove/amend entries in a database, we linked our app to our database, and we learned about setting up a testing environment.
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
You struck a good balance! I felt that we hit it off really well and really bounced off each other, it was lovely working with you and getting to know you a bit better :)
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
You were really good at explaining databases to me at the start of the session to make sure that I understood what was going on in the background.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
You were great at talking me through the different commands that we needed to use to interact with psql and edit our database table - you kept it really simple and easy to follow!

What do you think of the code we wrote together?
Claire was extremely helpful in explaining concepts, commands, and tools related to databases to me.  I am very thankful for this.  We also went through the directory's files to see how the code of each file relates to the code of another file and how this is outputted to the webpage.
Could you summarise the work we did together?
Productive and very educational.  Claire has been great to work with.
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
Good balance.
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
Claire was extremely helpful in explaining concepts, commands, and tools related to databases to me.  I am very thankful for this.  All was explained well.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
The concepts, commands, and tools related to databases through the use of psql, pg, TablePlus, ...

What do you think of the code we wrote together?
Totally on point, we even got to the point of highlighting errors in the section walkthroughs.
Could you summarise the work we did together?
Oh goodness, I feel terrible as this feedback is not timely. We worked on the afternoon challenge of the Bookmark manager and smashed a good 5 or 6 sections
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
We both like a good chat.. so a good balance was struck. We got on with our work, forged ahead and worked our socks off
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
It was a collaborative effort, so I'd say nothing well or not.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
That there are people out there with a similar drive and desire for new knowledge
