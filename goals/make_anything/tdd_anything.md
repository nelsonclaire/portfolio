# I can make anything

## I can TDD anything

### Personal Thoughts: What does it mean to be able to TDD anything?

TDD is one of the first things we have learnt at Makers, why is it given higher priority on getting to a solution over starting the coding? 

Being comfortable with test-driven development means that I am able to take any challenge set, and its user stories, and be able to write a first test. Once that is written I can then produce the code to pass that test. 
This leads to the `red`, `green` and then `refactor` cycle which ensures clean, minimal and well-designed code, with maximum test coverage. The Makers workshop related to this is [TDD](https://github.com/nelsonclaire/Portfolio/blob/master/workshops/tdd-intro.md)

All of my challenges at Makers have the following included in their README.md:

## My approach

1. Break down into simple steps 

2. Write first unit test 

3. Follow red, green, refactor cycle for each test with commits before a refactor

4. Continue with simple tests 

5. Repeat until basic user story functionality is covered
