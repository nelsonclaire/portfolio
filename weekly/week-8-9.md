# Week 8 and 9

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

## Goals

By the end of these two weeks I can:

* Use high-quality processes to build a project in a team
* Merge any branch into `main` automatically deploys after passing automated tests.
* Ensure all code on `main` is containerised.
* Deploy `main` into production.
