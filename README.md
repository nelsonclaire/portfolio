# Claire Nelson - Makers Portfolio

This is my learning journey at Makers Academy January 2022 - April 2022.

This portfolio will include examples of my work, the challenges completed working whilst pair programming and independently, and finally the goals I set myself and how I achieved them using the processes I learnt and developed over the three months.

# Strength of evidence

Summed up in the acronym CEP, standing for:

* Credible
* Empirical
* Personal

**Weak evidence is personal.** It's based on your personal feelings, thoughts, or impressions of an event.

**Moderate evidence is empirical.** It's based on things like written or quoted feedback, your verified capability to apply a skill through actually doing it, events where you have demonstrated competence, code that works, following a process correctly, etc.

**Strong evidence is credible.** It's empirical evidence backed up by expertise or events that couldn't reasonably mean anything else. For example, if you explain a topic to a beginner and then they can apply it straight afterwards, that's credible.
