# Week 3

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------

## Goals

By the end of this week I can:

* Build a simple web app
* Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
* Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
* Explain the MVC pattern

1. Pairing using the driver-navigator style during afternoons
    - [Battle](https://github.com/nelsonclaire/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/battle.md)

2. Weekend challenge to consolidate what I have learnt this week
    - [Airport](https://github.com/nelsonclaire/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/rps.md)

07/02/2022 Pairing feedback from Charlotte Buchan
-------------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
Our code was great :D
Could you summarise the work we did together?
We worked on setting up Sinatra and getting to grips with web app design.
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
Whilst it was fun pairing with you and great talking, perhaps work on being a little slower when approaching the tasks.
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
I don't think there was a chance to explain something as we were both on the same level for the new exercises.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
That it's ok not to know the answers.

08/02/2022 Pairing feedback from Jane Parsons
---------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
I thought we wrote good succinct code. We played with our options and tried things out to learn more, which we did.
Could you summarise the work we did together?
We worked on the Battle challenge together, where we introduced navigating from one "view" to another via the app.rb, also incorporating posting and getting parameters to display on the views
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
I thought we worked really really well together and had a great balance between us. That in itself made this a very enjoyable session, but I also learn so much too, so it was an fabulous afternoon for me.
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
You explained everything well Claire - the one explanation that stands out was experimenting with the "routes" to get the browser to keep the functionality going round in the browser - if you see what I mean :-) Thank you Claire :-)
What did you learn from pairing with me?
Big leap in my understanding of the 'routing' mechanism between views
That I'd love to pair with you again :-)

09/02/2022 Pairing feedback from Chris Middleton
------------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
Great. Good progress on something completely new!
Could you summarise the work we did together?
Started developing a web app using capybara feature tests
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
Good balance! You do speak your thoughts, which has its pros and cons from a clarity pov. But generally you were aware and addressed this as it was happening!
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
Together we helped understand how the variables we were using were instantiated. I dont think I would have the current clarity of understanding that i do now if I was doing it solo. Thank you!
What did you learn from pairing with me?
An improved understanding of the routes in web apps

10/02/2022 Pairing feedback from Ben Hall
-----------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
Brilliant, really good and found it hammered home a lot of what we'd done at the start of the week
Could you summarise the work we did together?
When we started we had the bear bones of a Battle app, by the end we'd added functionality to start battles and deduct hitpoints from one player
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
Good balance.
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
Tricky - when we were trying to create the global variables and remove the sessions one's, I hit a bit of a blind spot, but you guided me through it well.
I hate providing positive only feedback, but there really was nothing I'd have changed about our session.  You've clearly learnt a lot this week, are using that knowledge and I found you a big help and a fun and knowledgeable pair.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
I thought I came out of it with a better understanding of the form creation, how all the MVC structure links together and a fair bit more confidence (after a few struggles the day before, it was nice to make some real progress
```

11/02/2022 Pairing feedback from Haroon Fatih
---------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
The code we wrote together was really well written and clear.
Could you summarise the work we did together?
We worked on the battle challenge. We wrote code that allowed players to viewing HP and attacking player 2.
Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
You struck a good balance.
What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
You explained how to do testing really well.
What did you learn from pairing with me?
I became more confident with feature testing.
