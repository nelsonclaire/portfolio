# Week 2

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

## Goals

By the end of this week I can:

* Use all of week 1's skills 
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

1. Pairing using the driver-navigator style during afternoons

2. Weekend challenge to consolidate what I have learnt this week
    - [Takeaway](https://github.com/nelsonclaire/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/takeaway.md)

I have taken part in my first code review using the weekend Airport Challenge. I have reviewed another developers code and provided constructive feedback on their work.
