# Code Review

## Learning objectives

1. Describe high quality code
1. Explain why development teams do code reviews
1. Use a GitHub pull request to review someone else's code

## Introduction (15 min)

### What is high quality code?

Code is high quality when it is **easy to change**. Some common changes are:
- **fix** a bug
- **enhance** with a new feature
- **expand** an existing feature

You might think that the quality of your code does not matter to your customers,
because they cannot see it. But customers _do_ care that you can fix bugs and
release new features quickly.

In order to change some code, the first task is to understand it.

What attributes of code make it easier to change?

### How can we improve our code?

We can use tools to help us improve code quality:
- use a code linter
- write tests
- check the tests pass

However, these tools have limitations. What can't the tools tell us about our
code?

To address these limitations most development teams perform code review using
_change requests_. On GitHub these are called _pull requests_. Typically a
developer works on some code and asks another developer to review it.

### Let's help others improve

Let's focus on helping others improve collaboratively. This is a key skill for
all developers working as part of a team.

The better everyone in your team is, the better work everyone can do,
the better your code becomes, the more value you can deliver to customers.

## Exercise (60 min)

### 1. Prepare for code review (solo)

1. Create a pull request for your weekend challenge
1. Summarise what user stories are included in the pull request description
1. Point out anything incomplete
1. Draw attention to anything you'd like to improve
1. Send the pull request link to your pair

### 2. Do a code review (solo)

First, read this :pill:
[guide to code review](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/how-to/code-review.md).

Review your pair's code **without referring to the challenge rubric**. Stretch
yourself to see how much feedback you can think of before you move on.

Write your feedback as comments on their pull request. Use
[line comments](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request)
to give feedback in context.

1. **Appreciate** at least one thing you like in the pull request. For example:
a clear name, something easy to understand, or a good test case.
1. **Suggest** at least one thing that might improve the code. Try to give a
reason why your suggestion would be an improvement.
1. **Respond** to any questions the author has asked. Illustrate your answers
using code snippets and links to relevant resources. If you don't know, then say
so.

### 3. Improve your code (in pairs)

When you have both completed steps 1 and 2, read the feedback on your own pull
requests.

1. Choose one improvement to make to your challenge and make a commit to
address it.
1. Push it and see the update on your pull request.
1. Repeat with your pair's challenge.

## Plenary (15 min)

Let's gather and pool any outstanding questions we have and share any resources
we think could help us improve the quality of our code.

And let's reflect on our code review feedback:
- What feedback helped you improve?
- What feedback didn't help you?
