# Project: Boris Bikes

## Towards achieving these goals

- I can pair program
- I can model anything
- I can TDD anything

------

## Action Plan

Details [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/boris_bikes)

------

## Evidence

- I can answer yes to the following...
  - I can diagram and explain my TDD process to my peers and/or a coach
  - I have collected feedback from my peers about how I am as a pair partner that shows I am improving

--------------------------------------------------
What do you think of the code we wrote together?
I think the code we wrote together (both the testing and the program one) was simple, and geared to solving the challenges that were given to us. I think we came up with similar solutions in the code we wrote, and I think the code we wrote was the product of collaborative thinking.

Could you summarise the work we did together?
Explored error messages in a Ruby environment (for example, when we try to "do something" with an instance (the DockingStation class, for example) that was nowhere defined previously.
Explored the Domain Model from User Stories: we've created schemas of the objects/actions we need from a program, starting from "user narratives" (in other words: the specifications of our program were given to us in the form of user experiences or requirements, and we distilled those into tables/diagrams)
We've created a basic test around a specific feature of the program (the DockingStation object that _responds to_ an action request (release_bike).
We've created basic code to fulfull the test requirements.

Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?
I think you had a good balance of talking and listening. There were times when we were independently trying to figure out solutions to problems by googling things; other times when we "thought out loud", other times when we listened to each other. I also liked the natural way and organic approach to non-programming chat.

What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?
You explained well some concepts around git . I also found reassuring that we had a similar understanding of the main issues around the error messages we found throughout the steps (DomainName errors). I don't think there was something you didn't explain or express well.

What did you learn from pairing with me?
I learnt some git and CLI commands I didn't know or did not remember at hand. It was also my first full pair programming session, and I think I learnt the basics of the driver/navigator principles.
