# Week 5

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------

## Goals

By the end of this week I can:

* Build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review
