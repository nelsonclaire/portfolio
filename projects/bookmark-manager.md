#### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

- **Can you build a web app that uses a database?**

You can find more detailed learning objectives for this challenge [here](./learning_objectives.md).

### Reminder of all this week's goals from the [Week Outlines](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/week_outlines.md)

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Build a simple web app with a database (this primary goal breaks down into the two sub-goals below)
* Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
* Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

### Main focuses for this week

- Agile and TDD
- Engineering and 'Dev Recipes'
- Databases
- Tooling

As well as these things, you'll deepen your understanding of many of the [skills and concepts from week 3](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/main/intro_to_the_web).


## The project

You're going to build a bookmark manager.  A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse bookmarks other users have added. You can comment on the bookmarks.

### User Interface Sketch (Hi-Fi)

This is the basic view of the website. You will build it by working through the sequence of challenges. As you go on, we will be challenging you to extend the functionality of this website.
